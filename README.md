# Migration from `python-pkidb`

Due to the inability of Golang to handle encryptes private SSL keys (see [crypto/tls: needs a convenience function for reading encrypted keys](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/6722))
all encrypted private keys (for the CA and/or CRL signing) must be converted the PKCS8 format, encrypted with PKCS5 v2 algorithm and stored in the DER format.
This can be done by using `openssl pksc8` e.g.:

`openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -in ca_private.key -out ca_private.der -outform DER`

## Known issues
### Go!

* [crypto/x509: CRL generated by Certificate.CreateCRL is non-conforming and should be version 2](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/35428)
