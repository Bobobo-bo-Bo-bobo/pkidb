# Changes from `python-pkidb`
## Getopt short options are no longer supported
Due to the switch Go! the command-line parsing changes to standard Go! behavior and as a consequence getopt short options are no longer supported.

## Basic constraints
[RFC 5280 - Section 4.2.1.9](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-4.2.1.9) only defines two basic constraints - `CA` and `pathlen` - and doesn't define the criticality of the basic constraints. As a consequence the critical flag has been removed for basic constraints and basic constraints are limited to `CA` and `pathlen`.

Additionally supplied `pathlen` will not set (and an error occures) if `CA` is not set and key usage does not include `keyCertSign`.
This is mandated by RFC 5280: _<u>CAs MUST NOT include the pathLenConstraint field unless the CA boolean is asserted and the key usage extension asserts the keyCertSign bit</u>._)

## Subject alternative names
The criticality of the subject alternative names depend on the subject fields (see [RFC 5280 - Section 4.2.1.6](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-4.2.1.6)). To ensure generation of valid (according to RFC 5280) certificates the possibility to define the criticality has been removed.

## Key usage flags are always marked as critical
Keyusage flags (`pkidb sign --keyusage=...`) are **_always_** defined as CRITICAL as defined in [RFC 5280 - Section 4.2.1.3](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-4.2.1.3) (_<u>When present, conforming CAs SHOULD mark this extension as critical</u>_).

Hence the option to set the criticality flag of the keyusage flags has been removed.

## Extended key usage flags
[RFC 5280 - Section 4.2.1.12](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-4.2.1.12) defines the behavior for clients to process key usage and extended key usage flags independently and use the certificate as defined by *BOTH* flags. So it's pointless to define the critical flag and the possibility to define it has been removed.

The extended key usage flag `any` has been added.

## Signing algorithm for certificate revocation list is ignored
The generation function for certificate revocation list ([x509.Certitifate.CreateCRL](https://golang.org/pkg/crypto/x509/#Certificate.CreateCRL)) always use SHA256. This is hardcoded in the function and can't be changed, so the value for `crl_digest` will be ignored.

# Migration from `python-pkidb`
## Encrypted private keys
Due to the inability of Golang to handle encryptes private SSL keys (see [crypto/tls: needs a convenience function for reading encrypted keys](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/6722))
all encrypted private keys (for the CA and/or CRL signing) must be converted the PKCS8 format, encrypted with PKCS5 v2 algorithm and stored in the DER format.
This can be done by using `openssl pksc8` e.g.:

`openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -in ca_private.key -out ca_private.der -outform DER`

## Known issues
### Go!

* [crypto/x509: CRL generated by Certificate.CreateCRL is non-conforming and should be version 2](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/35428)
